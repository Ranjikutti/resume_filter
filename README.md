# Fuzzy Logic Resume Screening Assistant üìÑüß†

This is a full-stack web application that uses a fuzzy logic inference system to intelligently screen resumes and provide a "Candidate Fit Score". The application features two modes: a detailed manual entry form and an automated analysis mode that extracts data directly from an uploaded PDF resume.
